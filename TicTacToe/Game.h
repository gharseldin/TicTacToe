     I created the board and player as private variables since no one outside of the class really needs to access them
     I also created a number of private functions to help with the flow of the game. Again they are all private becuase
     no one really needs to access those functions from the outside. They are the internals of how the game works.
     If you notice you'll see that the functions don't really need any parameters. That is because they can accessattributes
     board and player directly because they are inside the same class. So all methods can see those attributes and work
     with them directly.
